## Sherpa: 


## Hiking Application designed to take the hassle and confusion out of finding local hikes. Whether you are just getting into the outdoors or have hiked the PCT several times, Sherpa is here for you!

- Sherpa is an application designed to take in User information:

- Location -> Where will you be hiking
Distance(slider) -> Ideal length of hike you are looking for
- Difficulty Rating -> How difficult of a hike you are looking for?
- From there we will render the top 10-20 hikes matching user specifications.

## Key Features:
-  Renders each Hike in a unique Card that displays
- Preview image of the hike
Description of the Hike
- Distance 
- Difficulty Rating
- Save Button: 
- Allows the user to save Hike information to a profile page to go back and reference later. 
- APIT: We would be utilizing a Hiking API that we would poass in queries to pull information based on the user search. 

# Potential API’s: 
-  https://prescriptiontrails.org/api/
-  https://www.trailforks.com/about/metadata/

# MVP:
- Scrape the Hiking API to render Top 10-20 hikes by user location. Allow the user to save a hike card to their user profile. User profile will render that card/any other cards saved. Delete saved hikes from a user profile.

# Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work? 

- We have a set schedule and clear delegation of daily tasks. Stand-up meetings followed by close of day meetings to manage workflow and progress/issues.

# What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

- Begin with 1:1 communication between the 2 parties who are having conflict.
If the issue persists: As a group we will come together to help workout the issue as a collective and remind everyone we are here as a cohesive unit to work together, not be at odds..
If group resolve fails: We will request outside mediation from an instructor, this will either be help as a group or between the two conflicting parties and an instructure; dependent upon comfort level of the parties and the issue. 






# What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute? 

- Have a mention of it at stand up in the am and if possible have the steamroller take on the role of navigator in pair programming that day.

# How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level? 

- Pair programming to catch up and educate disparate skill levels.

# How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

- Publicly after privately. If problem persists, then with the instructors

# How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful? 

- When private addressing and public addressing does not solve the issue to group unanimous satisfaction.

# What hours will you be available to communicate? 

- 9am pst to 6pm pst and later as needed. Communication can be guaranteed until 6pm and after as needed.

# What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)? 
- Discord

# How often will you take breaks?

- As needed at least every hour and 1 hour for lunch

# What is your plan if you start to fall behind? 

- Reassess and extend working hours until MVP is complete

# How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend? 

- Discord

# What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard? 

- Stand-up meeting will be democratic: led by a different member every day.

# How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up? 

- Support one another and have an agreement in place from day one emphasizing the value of team members input in any capacity.

# How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general? 

- Trello 
- Morning Stand-Ups -> What we will be working on and what dependencies we require to get it done.
- Evening Stand-ups -> Useful to share what was accomplished and what problems still arise.


# What project management tool will be used? 

- Github
- Miro


# What components of your project will live on GitHub?

- Front-End Repo
- Server-side Repo
- How will you share the repository with your teammates? 
- We created a Github Org. with Admin positions and read/write    authorizations set. 



# What is your Git flow? 

- Work on individual branches and have at least two members(code leads) review all submits before merges. 

# Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider: Yes

- How many people must review a PR? 
2

# Who merges PRs? 

- Dario/Jacob

# How often will you merge? 
- Feature completion. 

# How will you communicate that it’s time to merge? 

- We will be communicating throughout the work day via REMO & Discord. We will all have had a morning stand up discussing what needs to be done and will communicate to those group members who are directly working on features affecting others.
